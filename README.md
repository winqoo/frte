# freshflow_test

Due to permissions issue on firebase I wasn't able to fully test it.
(user is logged in but when fetching cart items i keep getting

failed: Status{code=PERMISSION_DENIED, description=Missing or insufficient permissions.

error. Can be easily fixed but I don't have access to firebase console
)



Debugging took me some time thus
I havent implemented analytics

I would definetly write tests for existing code.

App wasn't properly tested on iOS, the first run due to firebase takes super long.
